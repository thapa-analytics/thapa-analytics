# 👋 Hi, I’m Ganesh Thapa

I am an **Agricultural Economist** with the **Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR)**, specializing in applied microeconomics, spatial econometrics, and geospatial data science for policy evaluation.

My work integrates large administrative datasets, household surveys, and high-resolution environmental monitoring data to quantify how ecological conditions and regulatory interventions affect economic outcomes — including wildlife recreation participation, property markets, public health compliance costs, and regional economic activity.
